{"answer":"Playoff basketball sparks a lot of conversation, and while opinions vary, some common threads emerge. One notable point is that some teams, like the Magic, have impressed despite their shortcomings. For example, the Magic, even with awful shooting, have pushed the defending champions. A key issue highlighted is the absence of a reliable secondary playmaker; without one, the primary shot creator faces intense defensive focus from opposing teams, which can hinder offensive flow. However, some observers express disappointment with teams like the Magic, particularly regarding their offensive style, with one commenter saying they have been disgusted watching them play. The Magic's offensive struggles are further compounded by a lack of consistent three-point shooting, drawing comparisons to early 2000s basketball, which, while nostalgic for some, is not seen as a recipe for playoff success. On a brighter note, young players like Paolo Banchero and Franz Wagner are earning praise for their performance. Some fans see them as a promising wing duo built for the playoffs. Additionally, there's discussion around player perception, with some arguing that certain players, like Julius Randle, are judged based on outdated impressions.
