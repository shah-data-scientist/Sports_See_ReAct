This is where eras of parity are bad for casual viewers. It takes time and prolonged dominance to attract the attention of casual viewers. Casual viewers that don't live and breathe the NBA probably still think LeBron and Curry are the best players in the world. They don't realize that the Thunder are a historically great team; or that the Pacers are in back to back conference finals. Having 7 different teams and sets of players win the last finals is exciting for die-hard fans, but bad for casual viewers as there is no opportunity for continual discourse about a team that's dominating. 0\n",

Im not anti-physicality but am a fan of talent and skill in the game: Orlando and Houston have very little Both teams are hilariously overmatched in terms of shooting and scoring ability and have resorted to shots and fouls to hurt their opponents instead of actually with their game. I'm not going to reward or applaud that behavior, not some equalizing skill to try to injure your opponents. Goons like Anthony Mason and Bill Laimbeer were bad for the game and would've said as much at the time:\n",

He had actual poor playoff series against the Hawks; with 3 million year old DRose as the next best player on the roster; and then had like 3 ankle sprains in 2 weeks the next time the Knicks made the playoffs. This is his first opportunity to shine; and it's been to watch him and donte in these playoffs on another team. 4 1 &\n",

Hopefully it's Ivey. Cade is sloppy with the ball and forces a lot of bad turnovers but he's kind of in the position he has to. Too many possessions where we can't even the ball inside 30 feet of the basket if he doesn't touch the ball 4\n",
