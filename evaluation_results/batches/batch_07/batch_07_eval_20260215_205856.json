This is where eras of parity are bad for casual viewers. It takes time and prolonged dominance to attract the attention of casual viewers. Casual viewers that don't live and breathe the NBA probably still think LeBron and Curry are the best players in the world. They don't realize that the Thunder are a historically great team; or that the Pacers are in back to back conference finals. Having 7 different teams and sets of players win the last finals is exciting for die-hard fans, but bad for casual viewers as there is no opportunity for continual discourse about a team that's dominating. 0\n",

      "answer": "Here's a comparison of the advanced efficiency metrics (PIE, TS%) for the MVP candidates and an explanation of what these metrics reveal about player impact:\n\n*   **Giannis Antetokounmpo**: PIE of 21, TS% of 62.5\n*   **Jayson Tatum**: PIE of 15.8, TS% of 58.2\n*   **Joel Embiid**: PIE of 16.9, TS% of 58\n*   **Luka Dončić**: PIE of 17, TS% of 58.7\n*   **Nikola Jokić**: PIE of 20.6, TS% of 66.3\n\nPIE (Player Impact Estimate) attempts to measure a player's overall statistical impact on a game. TS% (True Shooting Percentage) measures shooting efficiency, considering 2-point field goals, 3-point field goals, and free throws. Higher values in both metrics generally indicate a greater positive impact and efficiency. For example, Nikola Jokić has a very high TS% and a PIE, suggesting he is both highly efficient and impactful.\n\nSources: NBA Database, u/mokaloca82 (457 upvotes), u/mokaloca82 (457 upvotes), u/mokaloca82 (457 upvotes), u/mokaloca82 (457 upvotes), u/hqppp (1300 upvotes)",
