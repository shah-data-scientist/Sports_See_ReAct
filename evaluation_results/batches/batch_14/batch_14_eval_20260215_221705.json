It's a few mini-Game 7s amongst not-great but not - completely-awful teams which makes for a nice appetizer going into the playoffs. Personally find it very interesting to see more flawed average teams in that situation as you get to learn things about teams and players you otherwise wouldn't; because they'd either miss the playoffs entirely or get bounced quickly in the first round by a much better team_ re: the Mavs, don't think tanked; it was actually disastrous for them to miss the playoffs after the Luka trade and it was almost entirely down to injuries got lucky in the lottery but we know what their odds were; and it's really not worth tanking out of the play-in for such low odds.

He had actual poor playoff series against the Hawks; with 3 million year old DRose as the next best player on the roster; and then had like 3 ankle sprains in 2 weeks the next time the Knicks made the playoffs. This is his first opportunity to shine; and it's been to watch him and donte in these playoffs on another team. 4 1 &\n",
