### Query #5: What do people debate about his efficiency?

**Type:** vector | **Category:** conversational

**Complete Answer:**
```
People debate the usefulness of efficiency as a metric when evaluating Reggie Miller. Some argue that he wasn't a "pure" point guard and wasn't consistently able to take advantage of double teams because he wasn't enough of a distributor. Others question the sorting and calculation methods used in efficiency statistics, especially when comparing players across different eras.

### Query #10: Which young players under 25 are putting up the best numbers, and what do fans expect from the next generation?

**Type:** hybrid | **Category:** hybrid_young_talent

**Complete Answer:**
```
Paolo Banchero and Franz Wagner are considered a dynamic young duo. Some think that Paolo Banchero could put up even better numbers if his team weren't last in pace and scoring. There is hope that with health, more 3-point shooting, and the continued growth of Paolo and the Wagners, the Magic will be a regular conference contender.
