In large part, the efficiency that you see here is the product of Reggie's very limited shot-making arsenal. The guy wasn't nearly as versatile a scorer as players Jordan, Kobe and Bird who handled the ball much more; made plays for others as well as themselves; drove the ball, played through contact; etc, none of which Reggie had the physicality to do. Even compared to Steph; Reggie was a much, much more circumscribed scorer.\n",

Jordan's calling card was a volume that Reggie; or anyone else for that matter, could not match year after year. But he never had a spike in efficiency on that volume like we've seen from Durant or LeBron . or Reggie: The only players with multiple postseasons at 29 10 are those 3 and Kawhi.

I'm not old enough to have seen West or Robertson but it's hard to stack their list of accomplishments and make a great case for Reggie: Like Jerry West was first team all-NBA ten times and Reggie was third team three times No comparison really. They had great teammates but also played when there were much fewer teams so all the top teams were absurdly loaded. As for Wade; he was just better at his peak. Carried his team to a championship and was just generally a more dominant force at both ends of the court. Can't really talk about Wade's lean years when Reggie didn't win a playoff series until his sixth season. And Wade's post-2011 fall off included him a top 3 player on two championship teams. Reggie played on some very good teams too. When everything around him was good; he made a lot of noise in the postseason but he just never reached the same heights and the longevity isn't enough to overcome that in my opinion\n",

Some fans feel that Reggie Miller was ahead of his time and would be just as effective in today's game, while others argue that his efficiency was a product of his limited shot-making arsenal compared to more versatile scorers.\n\nSources: u/hqppp (1300 upvotes), u/hqppp (1300 upvotes), u/hqppp (1300 upvotes), u/hqppp (1300 upvotes), u/hqppp (1300 upvotes)",

In large part, the efficiency that you see here is the product of Reggie's very limited shot-making arsenal. The guy wasn't nearly as versatile a scorer as players Jordan, Kobe and Bird who handled the ball much more; made plays for others as well as themselves; drove the ball, played through contact; etc, none of which Reggie had the physicality to do. Even compared to Steph; Reggie was a much, much more circumscribed scorer.\n",

Reggie has the 4 most efficient postseason runs of any year where played 200 minutes, and if you include years with a single series, Jordan's most efficient is would be Reggie's 11th most. If you look at only postseasons 29 points per 75 or higher; Reggie has the three most efficient; and although only one of them was more than one series, that was a run; and the other two he went down in the first round scoring 30 on 69% & 72% TS. Jordan's calling card was a volume that Reggie; or anyone else for that matter, could not match year after year. But he never had a spike in efficiency on that volume like we've seen from Durant or LeBron . or Reggie: The only players with multiple postseasons at 29 10 are those 3 and Kawhi. And it's not like Jordan was inefficient. He had 4 postseasons at 32 +5, only other player with more than was LeBron with 3. (There's a 37 +9 and a 32 +14 in there for LeBron Imao)\n",
