This is where eras of parity are bad for casual viewers. It takes time and prolonged dominance to attract the attention of casual viewers. Casual viewers that don't live and breathe the NBA probably still think LeBron and Curry are the best players in the world. They don't realize that the Thunder are a historically great team; or that the Pacers are in back to back conference finals. Having 7 different teams and sets of players win the last finals is exciting for die-hard fans, but bad for casual viewers as there is no opportunity for continual discourse about a team that's dominating. 0\n",

It's a few mini-Game 7s amongst not-great but not - completely-awful teams which makes for a nice appetizer going into the playoffs. Personally find it very interesting to see more flawed average teams in that situation as you get to learn things about teams and players you otherwise wouldn't; because they'd either miss the playoffs entirely or get bounced quickly in the first round by a much better team_ re: the Mavs, don't think tanked; it was actually disastrous for them to miss the playoffs after the Luka trade and it was almost entirely down to injuries got lucky in the lottery but we know what their odds were; and it's really not worth tanking out of the play-in for such low odds. A statistical fluke doesn't change that\n",

You also had washed Kobe getting dumbasses voting him in and Klay when the Warriors averaged like 65+ wins season: That's like all of the non wild card guard slots guaranteed to be occupied.
