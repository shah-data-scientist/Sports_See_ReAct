Reggie has the 4 most efficient postseason runs of any year where played 200 minutes, and if you include years with a single series, Jordan's most efficient is would be Reggie's 11th most. If you look at only postseasons 29 points per 75 or higher; Reggie has the three most efficient; and although only one of them was more than one series, that was a run; and the other two he went down in the first round scoring 30 on 69% & 72% TS. Jordan's calling card was a volume that Reggie; or anyone else for that matter, could not match year after year. But he never had a spike in efficiency on that volume like we've seen from Durant or LeBron . or Reggie: The only players with multiple postseasons at 29 10 are those 3 and Kawhi. And it's not like Jordan was inefficient. He had 4 postseasons at 32 +5, only other player with more than was LeBron with 3. (There's a 37 +9 and a 32 +14 in there for LeBron Imao)\n",
