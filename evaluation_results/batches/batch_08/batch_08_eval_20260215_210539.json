This is where eras of parity are bad for casual viewers. It takes time and prolonged dominance to attract the attention of casual viewers. Casual viewers that don't live and breathe the NBA probably still think LeBron and Curry are the best players in the world. They don't realize that the Thunder are a historically great team; or that the Pacers are in back to back conference finals. Having 7 different teams and sets of players win the last finals is exciting for die-hard fans, but bad for casual viewers as there is no opportunity for continual discourse about a team that's dominating. 0\n",

For NBA fans it makes absolutely no sense. Fans were left out of the most recent CBA for profit-sharing; and I'm not sure see that changing anytime soon: In fact; you could even argue that we should want low ratings, since it would force the NBA to address fhe things that can control that are making people tune out way too many ads especially within the last minute; gambling references everywhere; free throw hunting; teams shooting 60 threes in a single game; no defense until playoffs, poor refereeing; etc.\n",

He was in this area before but now he's elite and it's obviously a vital component to closing out games and stifling runs 2 Jaden has taken an incremental step on offense; becoming much more willing/able to dribble - drive into short range pull-ups and attempts at the rim. Again; he would do this last season but now he's it with greater consistency. Donte as a bench creator /ball-handler who can hold his own somewhat on defense is a huge addition that helps mitigate Conley having down streaks. 4. Julius is less of a dynamic scorer compared to KAT but he still fills the role as a \"get-a-bucket\" iso guy. He's also a better passer off the dribble although that hasn't been as apparent in this series so far. 4 4\n",
