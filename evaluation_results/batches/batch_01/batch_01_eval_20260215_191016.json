This is where eras of parity are bad for casual viewers. It takes time and prolonged dominance to attract the attention of casual viewers. Casual viewers that don't live and breathe the NBA probably still think LeBron and Curry are the best players in the world. They don't realize that the Thunder are a historically great team; or that the Pacers are in back to back conference finals. Having 7 different teams and sets of players win the last finals is exciting for die-hard fans, but bad for casual viewers as there is no opportunity for continual discourse about a team that's dominating. 0\n",

And I'm not trying to underplay how good Miller was. would personally rank him as good or better than Scottie Pippen as far as the 9Os are concerned. Miller is probably in the top 10 if we're considering that he was way more consistent than a lot of players for that entire decade. He probably could have gotten by as a number 1 in the sense that he's a team's highest scorer, but he probably needed someone to handle the creation part of things and take some on-ball scoring load off of him to beat any of the teams he faced (and lost to) in the finals or conference finals. That's not really a knock on Miller IMO; though. That's why gave the example of Miller on a team like the 2004 Pistons. If he had a balanced team of really solid defensive and players that were comparable to that; he could probably outscore everyone on his team effectively and still win a championship. Compare to Miller's actual career: Mark Jackson was probably the best he as a creator. Chauncey is already an upgrade there. Maybe not as a pure creator; but his 3-Level scoring is already better at creating distraction for Miller than he ever had in Jackson: The best team Miller had overall was probably when he was nearing the later part of his career in the mid-20OOs and heading into retirement:. But then all got suspended for the whole \"Malice at the Palace\" situation. 4 7\n",

This is where eras of parity are bad for casual viewers. It takes time and prolonged dominance to attract the attention of casual viewers. Casual viewers that don't live and breathe the NBA probably still think LeBron and Curry are the best players in the world. They don't realize that the Thunder are a historically great team; or that the Pacers are in back to back conference finals. Having 7 different teams and sets of players win the last finals is exciting for die-hard fans, but bad for casual viewers as there is no opportunity for continual discourse about a team that's dominating. 0\n",
