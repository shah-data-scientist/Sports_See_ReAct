Reggie has the 4 most efficient postseason runs of any year where played 200 minutes, and if you include years with a single series, Jordan's most efficient is would be Reggie's 11th most. If you look at only postseasons 29 points per 75 or higher; Reggie has the three most efficient; and although only one of them was more than one series, that was a run; and the other two he went down in the first round scoring 30 on 69% & 72% TS. Jordan's calling card was a volume that Reggie; or anyone else for that matter, could not match year after year. But he never had a spike in efficiency on that volume like we've seen from Durant or LeBron . or Reggie: The only players with multiple postseasons at 29 10 are those 3 and Kawhi. And it's not like Jordan was inefficient. He had 4 postseasons at 32 +5, only other player with more than was LeBron with 3. (There's a 37 +9 and a 32 +14 in there for LeBron Imao)\n",

Also; egregious flopping foul bating bitches that people hate because play the game like that despite their insane Also; it is a common argument that them winning snubbed a more deserving player that happened to be Jokic both times, because; you know; he's the best player in the world right now. SGA is a top 3-5 player in this league. don't him that. He's so But it's hard to give him his flowers, celebrate him; or respect him when he chooses to play the game that way; manipulate the system instead of just hoopin honorably and ethically. He could be the MVP without all the stupid flailing, cartoon character as falls; and all the acting. That's the most frustrating part:. He's so damn good he doesn't need it, but does all that bitch made shit. You think Kobe would be caught doing that shit ever? Bird? Jordan? Kareem? Nash? Shaw? Timmy D? KG? Hellllll fuckin no. might have drawn fouls, but drawing fouls doing honest moves and taking actual shots attempting to make a bucket is a skill: SGA throwing himself to the ground when someone brushes his arm, and just flinging the ball in the general direction of the hoop is not a skill, it's some bitch ass cheese: Like the kid who won at mortal kombat by spamming the leg sweep or uppercut.

This is where eras of parity are bad for casual viewers. It takes time and prolonged dominance to attract the attention of casual viewers. Casual viewers that don't live and breathe the NBA probably still think LeBron and Curry are the best players in the world. They don't realize that the Thunder are a historically great team; or that the Pacers are in back to back conference finals. Having 7 different teams and sets of players win the last finals is exciting for die-hard fans, but bad for casual viewers as there is no opportunity for continual discourse about a team that's dominating. 0\n",

Here is how Reggie stacks up against 20 of the best first o...\n\n=== COMMENT (43/166) ===\nu/NotUrAvgShitposter (16 upvotes):\n-10j East was weak but West was way too strong; especially when it came to guards. West had 3 MVP guards; the occasional healthy CP3, and Dame. You also had washed Kobe getting dumbasses voting him in and Klay when the Warriors averaged like 65+ wins season: That's like all of the non wild card guard slots guaranteed to be occupied. Like Ant wouldn't sniff an all star appearance some years in that era either and he's the best SG and top 10 rn.\n",

There are at least a other guards who unlike Reggie actually won MVPs and/or Finals MVPs; so maybe efficiency isn't the most important statistic in measuring a guard's value:\n",
