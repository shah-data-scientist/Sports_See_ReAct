One user is impressed that a team with awful shooting has taken the defending champs to the brink, and is biased towards Paolo and Franz as a favorite young wing duo. Another user thinks that Indiana and Minnesota have been impressive. There is also a user who believes that Indiana has a legitimate shot against the Cavaliers in the next round because their offense is no joke.
