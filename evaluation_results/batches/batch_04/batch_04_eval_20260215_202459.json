He also plays defense with his chest, not hands so he doesn't get the fouls Kat did. Luka and Bron can't just shove Randle out of the way on every drive.\n",

This is where eras of parity are bad for casual viewers. It takes time and prolonged dominance to attract the attention of casual viewers. Casual viewers that don't live and breathe the NBA probably still think LeBron and Curry are the best players in the world. They don't realize that the Thunder are a historically great team; or that the Pacers are in back to back conference finals. Having 7 different teams and sets of players win the last finals is exciting for die-hard fans, but bad for casual viewers as there is no opportunity for continual discourse about a team that's dominating. 0\n",

And the stars are young with minimal name recognition amongst casual fans. Neither team has been good long enough to grow a bandwagon following either. The series should be great; and that might some viewers to turn into games 6 and 7 if it goes that long. But overall; don't get your hopes up it's going to be rough. I'd expect this one to be down with Milwaukee-Phoenix; and possibly even as low as the Bubble Finals.\n",

He was in this area before but now he's elite and it's obviously a vital component to closing out games and stifling runs 2 Jaden has taken an incremental step on offense; becoming much more willing/able to dribble - drive into short range pull-ups and attempts at the rim. Again; he would do this last season but now he's it with greater consistency. Donte as a bench creator /ball-handler who can hold his own somewhat on defense is a huge addition that helps mitigate Conley having down streaks. 4. Julius is less of a dynamic scorer compared to KAT but he still fills the role as a \"get-a-bucket\" iso guy. He's also a better passer off the dribble although that hasn't been as apparent in this series so far. 4 4\n",
