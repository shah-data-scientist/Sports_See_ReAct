He also plays defense with his chest, not hands so he doesn't get the fouls Kat did. Luka and Bron can't just shove Randle out of the way on every drive.\n",

      "answer": "The players who scored at least 1500 points and had at least 400 assists are Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Nikola Jokić, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Jayson Tatum, Devin Booker, Tyler Herro, Trae Young, Cade Cunningham, James Harden, Stephen Curry, LeBron James, Jalen Brunson, and Darius Garland. This dual threat capability signifies players who are not only high-volume scorers but also effective playmakers, capable of creating scoring opportunities for themselves and their teammates. Strategically, these players are highly valuable as they can lead both the scoring and assist categories for their teams, making them difficult to defend and allowing for versatile offensive strategies.\n\nSources: NBA Database, u/unknown (0 upvotes), u/unknown (0 upvotes), u/unknown (0 upvotes), u/unknown (0 upvotes), u/MannerSuperb (31 upvotes)",

He was in this area before but now he's elite and it's obviously a vital component to closing out games and stifling runs 2 Jaden has taken an incremental step on offense; becoming much more willing/able to dribble - drive into short range pull-ups and attempts at the rim. Again; he would do this last season but now he's it with greater consistency. Donte as a bench creator /ball-handler who can hold his own somewhat on defense is a huge addition that helps mitigate Conley having down streaks. 4. Julius is less of a dynamic scorer compared to KAT but he still fills the role as a \"get-a-bucket\" iso guy. He's also a better passer off the dribble although that hasn't been as apparent in this series so far. 4 4\n",
