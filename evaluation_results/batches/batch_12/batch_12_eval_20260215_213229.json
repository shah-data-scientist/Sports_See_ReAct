This is where eras of parity are bad for casual viewers. It takes time and prolonged dominance to attract the attention of casual viewers. Casual viewers that don't live and breathe the NBA probably still think LeBron and Curry are the best players in the world. They don't realize that the Thunder are a historically great team; or that the Pacers are in back to back conference finals. Having 7 different teams and sets of players win the last finals is exciting for die-hard fans, but bad for casual viewers as there is no opportunity for continual discourse about a team that's dominating. 0\n",

This is where eras of parity are bad for casual viewers. It takes time and prolonged dominance to attract the attention of casual viewers. Casual viewers that don't live and breathe the NBA probably still think LeBron and Curry are the best players in the world. They don't realize that the Thunder are a historically great team; or that the Pacers are in back to back conference finals. Having 7 different teams and sets of players win the last finals is exciting for die-hard fans, but bad for casual viewers as there is no opportunity for continual discourse about a team that's dominating. 0\n",
