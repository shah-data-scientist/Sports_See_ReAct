This is where eras of parity are bad for casual viewers. It takes time and prolonged dominance to attract the attention of casual viewers. Casual viewers that don't live and breathe the NBA probably still think LeBron and Curry are the best players in the world. They don't realize that the Thunder are a historically great team; or that the Pacers are in back to back conference finals. Having 7 different teams and sets of players win the last finals is exciting for die-hard fans, but bad for casual viewers as there is no opportunity for continual discourse about a team that's dominating. 0\n",

Reggie has the 4 most efficient postseason runs of any year where played 200 minutes, and if you include years with a single series, Jordan's most efficient is would be Reggie's 11th most. If you look at only postseasons 29 points per 75 or higher; Reggie has the three most efficient; and although only one of them was more than one series, that was a run; and the other two he went down in the first round scoring 30 on 69% & 72% TS. Jordan's calling card was a volume that Reggie; or anyone else for that matter, could not match year after year. But he never had a spike in efficiency on that volume like we've seen from Durant or LeBron . or Reggie: The only players with multiple postseasons at 29 10 are those 3 and Kawhi. And it's not like Jordan was inefficient. He had 4 postseasons at 32 +5, only other player with more than was LeBron with 3. (There's a 37 +9 and a 32 +14 in there for LeBron Imao)\n",
