Personally find it very interesting to see more flawed average teams in that situation as you get to learn things about teams and players you otherwise wouldn't; because they'd either miss the playoffs entirely or get bounced quickly in the first round by a much better team_ re: the Mavs, don't think tanked; it was actually disastrous for them to miss the playoffs after the Luka trade and it was almost entirely down to injuries got lucky in the lottery but we know what their odds were; and it's really not worth tanking out of the play-in for such low odds.

Also; egregious flopping foul bating bitches that people hate because play the game like that despite their insane Also; it is a common argument that them winning snubbed a more deserving player that happened to be Jokic both times, because; you know; he's the best player in the world right now. SGA is a top 3-5 player in this league. don't him that. He's so But it's hard to give him his flowers, celebrate him; or respect him when he chooses to play the game that way; manipulate the system instead of just hoopin honorably and ethically. He could be the MVP without all the stupid flailing, cartoon character as falls; and all the acting. That's the most frustrating part:. He's so damn good he doesn't need it, but does all that bitch made shit. You think Kobe would be caught doing that shit ever? Bird? Jordan? Kareem? Nash? Shaw? Timmy D? KG? Hellllll fuckin no. might have drawn fouls, but drawing fouls doing honest moves and taking actual shots attempting to make a bucket is a skill: SGA throwing himself to the ground when someone brushes his arm, and just flinging the ball in the general direction of the hoop is not a skill, it's some bitch ass cheese: Like the kid who won at mortal kombat by spamming the leg sweep or uppercut.
