### Query #4: Actually, I meant the Celtics

**Type:** sql | **Category:** conversational_correction

**Complete Answer:**
```
Some fans think that in previous years, the Celtics would have just taken an injury year from Tatum and then run it back, but now it looks like they are going to blow up the roster. One fan noted that the Celtics/Cavs saw a particular team as just an inconvenient four games before the playoffs began. Another fan said that the Celtics' series was the toughest last year. Someone else said that the Pacers are their backup favorite team after the Celtics because they're fun to watch.
