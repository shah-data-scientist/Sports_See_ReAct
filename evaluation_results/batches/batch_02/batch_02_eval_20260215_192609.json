Some comments suggest efficiency means a player doesn't always need to be the primary option but needs a good supporting cast. It's also noted that efficiency might be less obvious when only looking at counting stats. One user also pointed out that AD has the highest career playoff TS% of any player with a 20+ ppg average.\n\nSources: NBA Database, u/hqppp (1300 upvotes), u/hqppp (1300 upvotes), u/hqppp (1300 upvotes), u/hqppp (1300 upvotes), u/hqppp (1300 upvotes)",

Reggie has the 4 most efficient postseason runs of any year where played 200 minutes, and if you include years with a single series, Jordan's most efficient is would be Reggie's 11th most. If you look at only postseasons 29 points per 75 or higher; Reggie has the three most efficient; and although only one of them was more than one series, that was a run; and the other two he went down in the first round scoring 30 on 69% & 72% TS. Jordan's calling card was a volume that Reggie; or anyone else for that matter, could not match year after year. But he never had a spike in efficiency on that volume like we've seen from Durant or LeBron . or Reggie: The only players with multiple postseasons at 29 10 are those 3 and Kawhi. And it's not like Jordan was inefficient. He had 4 postseasons at 32 +5, only other player with more than was LeBron with 3. (There's a 37 +9 and a 32 +14 in there for LeBron Imao)\n",

Yes the supporting cast has been laughably bad at times around them offensively but they their asses off and really giving the Celtics a fight despite missing Suggs and the other Wagner brother. thkkk their floor spacers and average PG away from being an true contender -24\n",

He single handedly almost willed us to a game 7 but ran out of gas.\n",
