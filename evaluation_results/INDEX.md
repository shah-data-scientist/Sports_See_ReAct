**Access Pattern:**
```python
import json

with open('CONSOLIDATED_RESULTS.json', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    data = json.load(f)

# Access specific query
first_query = data['all_results'][0]
print(f"Question: {first_query['question']}")
print(f"Answer: {first_query['answer']}")
print(f"Metrics: {first_query['ragas_metrics']}")
```
