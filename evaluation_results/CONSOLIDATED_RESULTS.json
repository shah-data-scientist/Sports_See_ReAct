This is where eras of parity are bad for casual viewers. It takes time and prolonged dominance to attract the attention of casual viewers. Casual viewers that don't live and breathe the NBA probably still think LeBron and Curry are the best players in the world. They don't realize that the Thunder are a historically great team; or that the Pacers are in back to back conference finals. Having 7 different teams and sets of players win the last finals is exciting for die-hard fans, but bad for casual viewers as there is no opportunity for continual discourse about a team that's dominating. 0\n",

The guy wasn't nearly as versatile a scorer as players Jordan, Kobe and Bird who handled the ball much more; made plays for others as well as themselves; drove the ball, played through contact; etc, none of which Reggie had the physicality to do.

And I'm not trying to underplay how good Miller was. would personally rank him as good or better than Scottie Pippen as far as the 9Os are concerned. Miller is probably in the top 10 if we're considering that he was way more consistent than a lot of players for that entire decade. He probably could have gotten by as a number 1 in the sense that he's a team's highest scorer, but he probably needed someone to handle the creation part of things and take some on-ball scoring load off of him to beat any of the teams he faced (and lost to) in the finals or conference finals. That's not really a knock on Miller IMO; though. That's why gave the example of Miller on a team like the 2004 Pistons. If he had a balanced team of really solid defensive and players that were comparable to that; he could probably outscore everyone on his team effectively and still win a championship. Compare to Miller's actual career: Mark Jackson was probably the best he as a creator. Chauncey is already an upgrade there. Maybe not as a pure creator; but his 3-Level scoring is already better at creating distraction for Miller than he ever had in Jackson: The best team Miller had overall was probably when he was nearing the later part of his career in the mid-20OOs and heading into retirement:. But then all got suspended for the whole \"Malice at the Palace\" situation. 4 7\n",

This is where eras of parity are bad for casual viewers. It takes time and prolonged dominance to attract the attention of casual viewers. Casual viewers that don't live and breathe the NBA probably still think LeBron and Curry are the best players in the world. They don't realize that the Thunder are a historically great team; or that the Pacers are in back to back conference finals. Having 7 different teams and sets of players win the last finals is exciting for die-hard fans, but bad for casual viewers as there is no opportunity for continual discourse about a team that's dominating. 0\n",

      "answer": "Based on basketball discussions, particularly a Reddit post discussing Reggie Miller's efficiency, several factors are highlighted.\n\nReggie Miller is considered a highly efficient first option in NBA playoff history. Some comments suggest efficiency means a player doesn't always need to be the primary option but needs a good supporting cast. It's also noted that efficiency might be less obvious when only looking at counting stats. One user also pointed out that AD has the highest career playoff TS% of any player with a 20+ ppg average.\n\nSources: NBA Database, u/hqppp (1300 upvotes), u/hqppp (1300 upvotes), u/hqppp (1300 upvotes), u/hqppp (1300 upvotes), u/hqppp (1300 upvotes)",

Reggie has the 4 most efficient postseason runs of any year where played 200 minutes, and if you include years with a single series, Jordan's most efficient is would be Reggie's 11th most. If you look at only postseasons 29 points per 75 or higher; Reggie has the three most efficient; and although only one of them was more than one series, that was a run; and the other two he went down in the first round scoring 30 on 69% & 72% TS. Jordan's calling card was a volume that Reggie; or anyone else for that matter, could not match year after year. But he never had a spike in efficiency on that volume like we've seen from Durant or LeBron . or Reggie: The only players with multiple postseasons at 29 10 are those 3 and Kawhi. And it's not like Jordan was inefficient. He had 4 postseasons at 32 +5, only other player with more than was LeBron with 3. (There's a 37 +9 and a 32 +14 in there for LeBron Imao)\n",

This is where eras of parity are bad for casual viewers. It takes time and prolonged dominance to attract the attention of casual viewers. Casual viewers that don't live and breathe the NBA probably still think LeBron and Curry are the best players in the world. They don't realize that the Thunder are a historically great team; or that the Pacers are in back to back conference finals. Having 7 different teams and sets of players win the last finals is exciting for die-hard fans, but bad for casual viewers as there is no opportunity for continual discourse about a team that's dominating. 0\n",

Some people find efficiency as a metric useless, while others argue that the modern NBA is about maximizing efficiency and that the player with the highest absolute True Shooting percentage should be considered the most efficient in history. Some claim Reggie Miller has the 4 most efficient postseason runs of any year where played 200 minutes. Others are interested in where Anthony Davis would rank, as he may have the highest career playoff True Shooting percentage of any player with a 20+ point average.\n\nSources: u/hqppp (1300 upvotes), u/hqppp (1300 upvotes), u/hqppp (1300 upvotes), u/hqppp (1300 upvotes), u/hqppp (1300 upvotes)",

Reggie has the 4 most efficient postseason runs of any year where played 200 minutes, and if you include years with a single series, Jordan's most efficient is would be Reggie's 11th most. If you look at only postseasons 29 points per 75 or higher; Reggie has the three most efficient; and although only one of them was more than one series, that was a run; and the other two he went down in the first round scoring 30 on 69% & 72% TS. Jordan's calling card was a volume that Reggie; or anyone else for that matter, could not match year after year. But he never had a spike in efficiency on that volume like we've seen from Durant or LeBron . or Reggie: The only players with multiple postseasons at 29 10 are those 3 and Kawhi. And it's not like Jordan was inefficient. He had 4 postseasons at 32 +5, only other player with more than was LeBron with 3. (There's a 37 +9 and a 32 +14 in there for LeBron Imao)\n",

This is where eras of parity are bad for casual viewers. It takes time and prolonged dominance to attract the attention of casual viewers. Casual viewers that don't live and breathe the NBA probably still think LeBron and Curry are the best players in the world. They don't realize that the Thunder are a historically great team; or that the Pacers are in back to back conference finals. Having 7 different teams and sets of players win the last finals is exciting for die-hard fans, but bad for casual viewers as there is no opportunity for continual discourse about a team that's dominating. 0\n",

Again; he would do this last season but now he's it with greater consistency. Donte as a bench creator /ball-handler who can hold his own somewhat on defense is a huge addition that helps mitigate Conley having down streaks. 4. Julius is less of a dynamic scorer compared to KAT but he still fills the role as a \"get-a-bucket\" iso guy.

This is where eras of parity are bad for casual viewers. It takes time and prolonged dominance to attract the attention of casual viewers. Casual viewers that don't live and breathe the NBA probably still think LeBron and Curry are the best players in the world. They don't realize that the Thunder are a historically great team; or that the Pacers are in back to back conference finals. Having 7 different teams and sets of players win the last finals is exciting for die-hard fans, but bad for casual viewers as there is no opportunity for continual discourse about a team that's dominating. 0\n",

In large part, the efficiency that you see here is the product of Reggie's very limited shot-making arsenal. The guy wasn't nearly as versatile a scorer as players Jordan, Kobe and Bird who handled the ball much more; made plays for others as well as themselves; drove the ball, played through contact; etc, none of which Reggie had the physicality to do. Even compared to Steph; Reggie was a much, much more circumscribed scorer.\n",

He was in this area before but now he's elite and it's obviously a vital component to closing out games and stifling runs 2 Jaden has taken an incremental step on offense; becoming much more willing/able to dribble - drive into short range pull-ups and attempts at the rim.

Julius is less of a dynamic scorer compared to KAT but he still fills the role as a \"get-a-bucket\" iso guy. He's also a better passer off the dribble although that hasn't been as apparent in this series so far. 4 4\n",

This is where eras of parity are bad for casual viewers. It takes time and prolonged dominance to attract the attention of casual viewers. Casual viewers that don't live and breathe the NBA probably still think LeBron and Curry are the best players in the world. They don't realize that the Thunder are a historically great team; or that the Pacers are in back to back conference finals. Having 7 different teams and sets of players win the last finals is exciting for die-hard fans, but bad for casual viewers as there is no opportunity for continual discourse about a team that's dominating. 0\n",

The internet is convinced that the NFL is rigging games in favor of Kansas City, the 3Oth largest media market in the country. Dallas, LA, New York; Miami; Chicago; any of these major markets could be in the Super Bowl and the ratings would be largely on par with a Green vs Buffalo Super Bowl.\n",

Paolo Banchero (22 years old) scored 1191 points, had 345 rebounds, and 221 assists. In comparison, Kevin Durant (36 years old) scored 1649 points, had 372 rebounds, and 260 assists. LeBron James (40 years old) scored 1708 points, had 546 rebounds, and 574 assists. Stephen Curry (37 years old) scored 1715 points, had 308 rebounds, and 420 assists. This suggests that the league's future is bright, with young players like Sengun showing great potential. While the established stars still have higher point totals, the young players are not far behind and have time to develop further.\n\nSources: NBA Database, u/mokaloca82 (457 upvotes), u/mokaloca82 (457 upvotes), u/mokaloca82 (457 upvotes), u/mokaloca82 (457 upvotes), u/mokaloca82 (457 upvotes)",

This is where eras of parity are bad for casual viewers. It takes time and prolonged dominance to attract the attention of casual viewers. Casual viewers that don't live and breathe the NBA probably still think LeBron and Curry are the best players in the world. They don't realize that the Thunder are a historically great team; or that the Pacers are in back to back conference finals. Having 7 different teams and sets of players win the last finals is exciting for die-hard fans, but bad for casual viewers as there is no opportunity for continual discourse about a team that's dominating. 0\n",

SGA is a top 3-5 player in this league. don't him that. He's so But it's hard to give him his flowers, celebrate him; or respect him when he chooses to play the game that way; manipulate the system instead of just hoopin honorably and ethically. He could be the MVP without all the stupid flailing, cartoon character as falls; and all the acting. That's the most frustrating part:. He's so damn good he doesn't need it, but does all that bitch made shit. You think Kobe would be caught doing that shit ever? Bird? Jordan? Kareem? Nash? Shaw? Timmy D? KG? Hellllll fuckin no. might have drawn fouls, but drawing fouls doing honest moves and taking actual shots attempting to make a bucket is a skill: SGA throwing himself to the ground when someone brushes his arm, and just flinging the ball in the general direction of the hoop is not a skill, it's some bitch ass cheese: Like the kid who won at mortal kombat by spamming the leg sweep or uppercut.

He was in this area before but now he's elite and it's obviously a vital component to closing out games and stifling runs 2 Jaden has taken an incremental step on offense; becoming much more willing/able to dribble - drive into short range pull-ups and attempts at the rim.

Julius is less of a dynamic scorer compared to KAT but he still fills the role as a \"get-a-bucket\" iso guy.

This is where eras of parity are bad for casual viewers. It takes time and prolonged dominance to attract the attention of casual viewers. Casual viewers that don't live and breathe the NBA probably still think LeBron and Curry are the best players in the world. They don't realize that the Thunder are a historically great team; or that the Pacers are in back to back conference finals. Having 7 different teams and sets of players win the last finals is exciting for die-hard fans, but bad for casual viewers as there is no opportunity for continual discourse about a team that's dominating. 0\n",

This is where eras of parity are bad for casual viewers. It takes time and prolonged dominance to attract the attention of casual viewers. Casual viewers that don't live and breathe the NBA probably still think LeBron and Curry are the best players in the world. They don't realize that the Thunder are a historically great team; or that the Pacers are in back to back conference finals. Having 7 different teams and sets of players win the last finals is exciting for die-hard fans, but bad for casual viewers as there is no opportunity for continual discourse about a team that's dominating. 0\n",

This is where eras of parity are bad for casual viewers. It takes time and prolonged dominance to attract the attention of casual viewers. Casual viewers that don't live and breathe the NBA probably still think LeBron and Curry are the best players in the world. They don't realize that the Thunder are a historically great team; or that the Pacers are in back to back conference finals. Having 7 different teams and sets of players win the last finals is exciting for die-hard fans, but bad for casual viewers as there is no opportunity for continual discourse about a team that's dominating. 0\n",

This is where eras of parity are bad for casual viewers. It takes time and prolonged dominance to attract the attention of casual viewers. Casual viewers that don't live and breathe the NBA probably still think LeBron and Curry are the best players in the world. They don't realize that the Thunder are a historically great team; or that the Pacers are in back to back conference finals. Having 7 different teams and sets of players win the last finals is exciting for die-hard fans, but bad for casual viewers as there is no opportunity for continual discourse about a team that's dominating. 0\n",

This is where eras of parity are bad for casual viewers. It takes time and prolonged dominance to attract the attention of casual viewers. Casual viewers that don't live and breathe the NBA probably still think LeBron and Curry are the best players in the world. They don't realize that the Thunder are a historically great team; or that the Pacers are in back to back conference finals. Having 7 different teams and sets of players win the last finals is exciting for die-hard fans, but bad for casual viewers as there is no opportunity for continual discourse about a team that's dominating. 0\n",

I'm not old enough to have seen West or Robertson but it's hard to stack their list of accomplishments and make a great case for Reggie: Like Jerry West was first team all-NBA ten times and Reggie was third team three times No comparison really. They had great teammates but also played when there were much fewer teams so all the top teams were absurdly loaded. As for Wade; he was just better at his peak. Carried his team to a championship and was just generally a more dominant force at both ends of the court. Can't really talk about Wade's lean years when Reggie didn't win a playoff series until his sixth season. And Wade's post-2011 fall off included him a top 3 player on two championship teams. Reggie played on some very good teams too. When everything around him was good; he made a lot of noise in the postseason but he just never reached the same heights and the longevity isn't enough to overcome that in my opinion\n",

In large part, the efficiency that you see here is the product of Reggie's very limited shot-making arsenal. The guy wasn't nearly as versatile a scorer as players Jordan, Kobe and Bird who handled the ball much more; made plays for others as well as themselves; drove the ball, played through contact; etc, none of which Reggie had the physicality to do.

This is where eras of parity are bad for casual viewers. It takes time and prolonged dominance to attract the attention of casual viewers. Casual viewers that don't live and breathe the NBA probably still think LeBron and Curry are the best players in the world. They don't realize that the Thunder are a historically great team; or that the Pacers are in back to back conference finals. Having 7 different teams and sets of players win the last finals is exciting for die-hard fans, but bad for casual viewers as there is no opportunity for continual discourse about a team that's dominating. 0\n",

This is where eras of parity are bad for casual viewers. It takes time and prolonged dominance to attract the attention of casual viewers. Casual viewers that don't live and breathe the NBA probably still think LeBron and Curry are the best players in the world. They don't realize that the Thunder are a historically great team; or that the Pacers are in back to back conference finals. Having 7 different teams and sets of players win the last finals is exciting for die-hard fans, but bad for casual viewers as there is no opportunity for continual discourse about a team that's dominating. 0\n",

If the 7th seed is 4 or so games ahead, their spot should already be locked in. Same with the 8th, if are games ahead their spots should already be locked in.

Jordan's calling card was a volume that Reggie; or anyone else for that matter, could not match year after year. But he never had a spike in efficiency on that volume like we've seen from Durant or LeBron . or Reggie: The only players with multiple postseasons at 29 10 are those 3 and Kawhi. And it's not like Jordan was inefficient. He had 4 postseasons at 32 +5, only other player with more than was LeBron with 3. (There's a 37 +9 and a 32 +14 in there for LeBron Imao)\n",

If you look at only postseasons 29 points per 75 or higher; Reggie has the three most efficient; and although only one of them was more than one series, that was a run; and the other two he went down in the first round scoring 30 on 69% & 72% TS. Jordan's calling card was a volume that Reggie; or anyone else for that matter, could not match year after year. But he never had a spike in efficiency on that volume like we've seen from Durant or LeBron . or Reggie: The only players with multiple postseasons at 29 10 are those 3 and Kawhi.
