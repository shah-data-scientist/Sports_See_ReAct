# Coverage Thresholds Configuration
# Used by: scripts/global_policy/check_coverage_thresholds.py
#
# Tier definitions (generic — same across all projects):
#   tier1 = Critical modules (user-facing, data integrity)
#   tier2 = Standard modules (moderate risk)
#   tier3 = Best effort (UI, scripts, analysis)
#
# To apply to a new project:
#   1. Copy this file to project root
#   2. Adjust [modules] section to match your src/ directories
#   3. Tier thresholds are universal — change only if justified

[overall]
# Current: 78.45% (2026-02-12)
# Initial target: 75% (achievable with current test suite)
# Long-term goal: 80% (requires additional tests for chat.py, conversation.py, utils)
target = 75

[thresholds]
# Generic recommendations: tier1=90, tier2=70, tier3=50
# Sports_See initial targets (current coverage baseline):
# Tier 1: 77% (covers all except services at 77.0%)
# Tier 2: 24% (covers utils at 24.2% — marked for improvement)
# Tier 3: 50% (UI/scripts baseline)
tier1 = 77
tier2 = 24
tier3 = 50

[modules]
# Tier 1 — Critical: bugs here cause user-visible failures
services = "tier1"
core = "tier1"
models = "tier1"
api = "tier1"
repositories = "tier1"
tools = "tier1"

# Tier 2 — Standard: moderate risk, detectable failures
pipeline = "tier2"
evaluation = "tier2"
utils = "tier2"

# Tier 3 — Best effort: UI rendering, reports, static data
ui = "tier3"

[excluded_modules]
# Modules to exclude from coverage checks (e.g., UI requiring live server/browser)
# Set to true to exclude from threshold enforcement
ui = true
